Together with [Aseem][aseemk.com], I am proud to finally share what we’ve been
working on for the greater part of this year.

## Background
How come there’s a place where you can [follow your interests][twitter],
[connect with your friends & family][facebook], [share your photos][flickr],
[share the music you like][lastfm], [share your thoughts][blog], but none
where you can *share the things you have and want*?

Well, there is now. Enter [The Thingdom][thingdom].

## What is The Thingdom?

The Thingdom is a place where I can share [my photography gear][ex-1], [my movie
collection][ex-2], [my book shelf][ex-3], the [ultimate vacuum cleaner][ex-4],
find out [what my brother wants][ex-5] for his birthday, or what [my][thingdom-gz]
[friends][thingdom-424f] think about [a particular video game][ex-6].

I can’t wait to see what you are going to use it for!


## Call to Action
Go have a look around, sign up, [follow me][thingdom-profile], [let us
know what you think][feedback] and spread the word!
