title: Joining Microsoft
---
I am thrilled to announce that I'll be joining the <a href="http://seadragon.com">Seadragon team</a> at <a href="http://livelabs.com">Microsoft Live Labs</a> as a <em>research intern</em>. Ever since I first watched <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.html">Blaise Ag√ºera y Arcas present Seadragon &amp; Photosynth</a> at <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a>, I knew the Seadragon team was at the cutting edge of changing the way we will interact with vast amounts of visual information in the future.

<h2>All Good Things Come To An End</h2>
I've had a blast and learned a lot during my internship at <a href="http://seadragon.com/">Seadragon</a>. More importantly, I was fortunate enough to meet and spend time with many great people whom I dearly miss now.<br/>The internship ended at the beginning of January and I've returned to Switzerland in February.</a>.

Getting the chance to be a part of this group of extremely visionary &amp; talented people is a feeling I cannot describe. I am looking forward to finally meet some of the people I've had contact with over the last months in person, among them <a href="http://twitter.com/iangilman">Ian</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/aseemk">Aseem</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/benvanik">Ben</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mr_yuk">Kevin</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lutzg">Lutz</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/modeless">James</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/billcrow">Bill</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jaysenior">Jay</a>, and all those I haven't got to know so far.
They are the brilliant minds behind products &amp; projects such as <a href="http://seadragon.com/developer/silverlight">Silverlight Deep Zoom</a>, <a href="http://seadragon.com/developer/ajax">Seadragon AJAX</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seadragon-mobile/id299655981?mt=8">Seadragon Mobile</a>, <a href="http://seadragon.com">Seadragon.com</a>, <a href="http://photosynth.net">Photosynth</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XR"><strike>WMP</strike> <strike>HD Photo</strike> JPEG XR</a>, <a href="http://infinitecanvas.appjet.net/">Infinite Canvas</a>, <a href="http://gimmeshiny.com/">Gimme Shiny!</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pspplayer/">PSP Player</a>.

Personally I see working at Microsoft as a great opportunity to work on <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/zoomable-user-interfaces">all</a> <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/tandem">the</a> <a href="http://openzoom.org">things</a> <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/openzoom-description-format">I'm</a> <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">passionate</a> <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/gigapan-mobile">about</a> and potentially reach millions of people around the world.

Stay tuned as I'll share my stories about settling down in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=seattle+area&sll=47.64839,-122.122822&sspn=0.104427,0.2635&ie=UTF8&z=11&iwloc=A">Seattle area</a> and hopefully a bit about the stuff I'll be working on!

Yours,
Daniel

<h3>P.S. OpenZoom</h3>
<p class="footnote">As of next week active development of the <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/openzoom-sdk">OpenZoom SDK</a> on my part will be put on hold for the duration of my internship. I consider the features and components already included (<a href="http://openzoom.org/sdk/download/latest/zip">0.4.2.1 release</a>) fairly stable and as many people have shown it's very well suited to be used in real-world projects. Apart from that, I'll still try my best to answer questions and help out on the <a href="http://openzoom.org/go/community">OpenZoom community</a> whenever possible.</p>

<p class="footnote">I'd like to point that I made sure that the status of the <a href="http://openzoom.org">OpenZoom</a> project itself is not in any way affected by this announcement. It's still open source and free. Actually, I'd like to encourage other people to <a href="http://github.com/openzoom/sdk">fork it</a> and continue where I left off.</p>
