title: 'ZUI: The Next Step'
---
Yesterday I talked a little bit about zooming user interfaces. Today I came across this jaw-dropping video of Jeff Han&#x27;s Perceptive Pixels Multitouch Display. It perfectly demonstrates what experience is possible if we put together multitouch technology with zoomable user interfaces.

Enough talked. See for yourself&hellip;

<p>My vision for <a href="http://gasi.ch/photos/" title="tandem">tandem</a> is much more humble. It is about improving the experience for exploring Flickr. Part of that is harnessing the power of zoomable user interfaces. Another part, that I haven&#x27;t talked about yet, are filtering &amp; layouting techniques that enable us to digest information in a more intuitive way. What I am really trying to do is bring together the concepts others have explored before me and apply them to Flickr. It's as simple as that.</p>
In the spirit of Sir Isaac Newton:

P.S. Today I&#x27;ve got my <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/2007/11/07/zoomable-user-interfaces/#comment-142">first comment</a> (that is not spam) on this blog. Besides that, it is an interesting one, too. I am glad that I am not the only one being fascinated by the potential of ZUI. Franklin Servan-Schreiber of <a href="http://www.zoomorama.com/" title="Zoomorama">Zoomorama</a> is also working on bringing zooming to the web. To get an idea of what he&#x27;s up to, check out <a href="http://zoomorama.typepad.com/zooming/2007/09/index.html">this introductory blog post </a>and <a href="http://mail.zoomodev.com/ab5c3015b9361c504a573bdc8166f449">this beautiful example</a> of his work. Thanks, Franklin.
