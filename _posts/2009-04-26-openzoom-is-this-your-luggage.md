title: OpenZoom, <br/>Is This Your Luggage?
---
Lately I&#x27;ve been working a lot on very technical stuff around <a href="http://openzoom.org/">OpenZoom</a>. I  desperately needed a break.
Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.isthisyourluggage.com/">Is This Your Luggage</a> and I fell in love with the site instantaneously. But then I asked myself&hellip; <q>Wouldn&#x27;t this be even more awesome using zooming?</q>
Here we are, a couple of hours later. I&#x27;ve ripped apart the <a href="http://www.isthisyourluggage.com/">original site</a> and put it together again but this time in a zooming environment. One nice side-effect has been that I&#x27;ve found a couple of rough edges in the <a href="http://docs.openzoom.org/sdk/">OpenZoom SDK API</a> that I was able to improve due this quick real-world check. Alright, enough talked, check it out!

<h3>P.S.</h3>
This is supposed to demonstrate a bit what kind of experiences you can build with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-zoom/">OpenZoom SDK</a>. It doesn't always have to be high-resolution images and a boring layout. Hope you enjoy it. ;)
